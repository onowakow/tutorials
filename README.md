# Welcome to the Tutorial Docs

This repo contains the source material for my new tech tutorial blog. I hope to write about Angular and the Azure Cloud among other resources. Eventually, I want to use Docusaurus or an alternative static site scaffolder to deploy the blog.

**The purpose of these docs is to help developers as well as increase my material for job prospects.**
